This folder should be used to collect and keep up-to-date all the artifacts related to the Software Development Process activities, namely Requirements Engineering, OO Analysis and OO Design.

The artifacts should be developed in accordance with the [template files](../(template-files)).

**It is highly recommended to organize the content of each User Story into a dedicated subfolder (for example, content related to US10 should be located in a folder named US10).**
